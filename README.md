## 🚀 What I'm building in the AI era

**Production GenAI Systems:**
- **Fintech Document Intelligence** → Processing 200k+ docs/min with 99.5% accuracy (Azure + RAG + multi-model validation)
- **Agentic Compliance Engine** → AI agents that understand regulatory nuance and generate audit trails automatically
- **Identity-Preserving Portrait AI** → 95% cost reduction vs commercial APIs ($0.002 vs $0.03/image) using Stable Diffusion XL

**Backend & Infrastructure (the foundation):**
- **Event-driven architectures** handling millions of automated insurance claims
- **Distributed systems** that survive AWS outages and Black Friday traffic spikes  
- **Database optimizations** reducing query time from 45s → 200ms (225x improvement)

## 💡 My approach to building AI systems

```python
def architect_ai_system(business_requirements):
    """
    Lessons from shipping AI to production:
    1. Start with the data pipeline (garbage in, garbage out)
    2. Vector databases are the new relational databases
    3. Prompt engineering is systematic, not magic
    4. Always have a fallback to traditional algorithms
    5. Monitor for drift, hallucinations, and edge cases
    """
    if requires_compliance():
        return multi_layer_validation() + audit_trails()
    elif requires_scale():
        return async_processing() + caching_layers()
    return simple_and_maintainable()
```

## 🔧 Technology Arsenal

```yaml

  Infrastructure: AWS Bedrock, RunPod GPU Cloud, Qdrant
  Frameworks: LangChain, Hugging Face, PyTorch
  Specialties: RAG systems, agentic workflows, vector search

Backend Mastery (10+ years):
  Languages: Python, Java, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript  
  Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch
  Cloud: AWS (Certified), Kubernetes, Terraform
  Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ, EventBridge
  Monitoring: DataDog, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry

Frontend (when the backend engineers need UIs):
  Modern: React, Next.js, TypeScript
  # Because someone has to make it look pretty
```

## 🌐 Open Source Contributions

**Major Projects:**
- **[FAANG Interview Questions](https://github.com/ombharatiya/FAANG-Coding-Interview-Questions)** → 1.2k+ stars, comprehensive coding prep resource
- **[Screwdriver CI/CD](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd)** → 10+ merged PRs across UI, models, and core platform
- **[TranscriptAI](https://github.com/ombharatiya/transcript-ai)** → Multilingual transcription tool using OpenAI Whisper

**Technical Contributions:**
- Added GitHub/GitLab PR status validations to enterprise CI/CD platform
- Fixed import handling and status mapping for 10k+ engineers
- Built property matching algorithms targeting 100M+ records with sub-millisecond latency

## 🧠 Current Technical Obsessions

**Researching:** Multi-agent orchestration patterns and tool composition strategies  
**Experimenting:** Vector search optimization beyond cosine similarity  
**Reading:** "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (3rd time) and recent LLM architecture papers

**Recent revelation:** Properly designed caching layers can make any system feel fast. Improperly designed ones make everything feel broken.

## 🌍 Beyond the Terminal

- **Technical Leadership:** Mentoring engineers from "it works locally" to "it scales globally"
- **Content Creation:** Technical posts reaching 80k+ engineers (apparently I can explain complex things)
- **Architecture Reviews:** Helping teams avoid the microservices trap and other distributed systems pitfalls
- **Conference Speaking:** Sharing production war stories and lessons from scaling systems

**Travel Philosophy:** Visiting 14 countries primarily for WiFi speed comparisons and understanding global infrastructure patterns.

## 🎮 Side Quests & Debugging Life

When not architecting AI systems or optimizing database queries:

- Explaining why your "microservices" might actually be a distributed monolith
- Building tools that make Monday morning deployments less terrifying  
- Writing documentation that developers actually read (surprisingly difficult)
- Proving that good monitoring beats perfect code every time

**Fun fact:** Once reduced AWS costs by 45% through query optimization and felt like a financial wizard for exactly one sprint.

### 💬 Let's architect something together!

*Always excited to discuss AI system design, scaling challenges, or why your distributed system exhibits exactly the failure modes you tried to avoid*

**Love talking about:** AI/ML engineering • Vector databases • System design patterns • Performance optimization • That production incident that taught you everything
