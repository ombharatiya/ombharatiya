# Hey, I'm Om! 👋

### I build things that scale, break, and (hopefully) scale again

**Currently crafting distributed systems • Obsessed with performance • Secretly love debugging production fires 🔥**

## 🛠 What I'm building

**Right now:** Tinkering with GenAI agents that actually understand compliance rules (spoiler: it's harder than it looks)

**Always:** Systems that don't fall over when traffic spikes happen at 3 AM

**For fun:** Open source tools that make other developers' lives slightly less miserable

## 🧠 Things I think about

```bash
$ grep -r "why is this so slow" ~/brain/
→ Database indexes (or lack thereof)
→ N+1 queries hiding in plain sight  
→ That microservice that somehow became a monolith
→ Why Kubernetes makes simple things complicated
→ Whether this cache invalidation will actually work
```

## ⚡ My Stack (aka tools that don't make me cry)

```yaml
Languages: Java, Python, Go, JavaScript
          # C++ when I'm feeling masochistic

Cloud: AWS (the parts that actually work)
       Kubernetes (love-hate relationship)
       
Databases: PostgreSQL (reliable friend)
           Redis (fast friend) 
           DynamoDB (expensive friend)

Daily Drivers: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Kafka
               Docker, Terraform, way too much YAML
```

## 🎯 Recent Wins

🚀 **Built a document processing pipeline** that actually understands invoices (99.5% accuracy, take that OCR!)

⚡ **Optimized some database queries** from "grab coffee while it loads" to "blink and you'll miss it"

🤖 **Created a GenAI assistant** that writes better tickets than most humans (sorry, humans)

🔧 **Open sourced some pipeline tools** that 150+ teams now use (and hopefully don't curse at)

## 📚 Learning Corner

**Currently reading:** System design papers (yes, for fun)  
**Recently tried:** Rust (still fighting the borrow checker)  
**Next up:** WebAssembly (because why not?)

Fun fact: I once reduced AWS costs by 45% and felt like a financial wizard for a week.

## 🎮 When not coding

- Mentoring engineers who are way smarter than me
- Writing posts that somehow reached 80k+ people (still not sure how)
- Explaining why "it works on my machine" isn't a deployment strategy
- Collecting passport stamps (14 countries and counting, mostly for the WiFi speed comparisons)

### 💬 Let's chat!

*Love talking about system design, performance optimization, or why your distributed system is probably more distributed than it needs to be*

**Always up for:** Technical discussions, code reviews, or helping debug that thing that works everywhere except production

**PS:** If you're looking for my resume, it's probably on LinkedIn like everyone else's 😄
