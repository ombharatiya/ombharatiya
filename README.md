## What I'm building in the AI era

| System | Scale | Achievement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fintech Document AI | 200k docs/min | 99.5% accuracy, $0.01/doc (90% cost reduction) |
| Portrait Generation Pipeline | 10k+ cards/batch | 95% cost reduction vs commercial APIs |
| MCP Server Platform | O(log n) complexity | 33% infrastructure savings, 57% compute optimization |
| Database Optimization | 45s → 200ms queries | 225x performance improvement |
| System Reliability | 88% → 99.9% uptime | $2M+ saved in downtime costs |

## Core Stack

**AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Llama 3.1 • Stable Diffusion XL, InstantID • LangChain, PyTorch, Hugging Face • RAG systems, agentic workflows, vector search

**Backend:** Java, Python, Go, TypeScript • PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch • Kafka, AWS SQS, EventBridge

**Cloud:** AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, ECS/EKS, CDK) • Kubernetes, Terraform • NewRelic, DataDog, Prometheus

## My work

**[Agentic Compliance Engine](https://gist.github.com/ombharatiya/de4fe4c953859eb442499c6b143e02dd)**  
AI agents that understand regulatory nuance and auto-generate audit trails. Multi-modal validation pipeline with 98% audit completeness, reducing review time from 1-3 weeks to 2-4 hours.

**[DiffusionID Production Pipeline](https://github.com/ombharatiya/diffusion-id)**  
Identity-preserving portrait generation at scale. 8 seconds/image on RTX 4090, 450 images/hour throughput. Two-stage pipeline with automated PDF card generation.

**[FAANG Interview Questions](https://github.com/ombharatiya/FAANG-Coding-Interview-Questions)**  
1.2k+ stars. Comprehensive coding interview prep resource.

**[Screwdriver CI/CD](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/ui/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Aombharatiya)**  
10+ merged PRs across UI, models, and core platform. Added GitHub/GitLab PR validations for 10k+ engineers.

**[TranscriptAI](https://github.com/ombharatiya/transcript-ai)**  
Multilingual transcription using OpenAI Whisper.


## My approach to building AI systems

```python
def architect_ai_system(business_requirements):
    """
    Lessons from shipping AI to production:
    1. Start with the data pipeline (garbage in, garbage out)
    2. Vector databases are the new relational databases
    3. Prompt engineering is systematic, not magic
    4. Always have a fallback to traditional algorithms
    5. Monitor for drift, hallucinations, and edge cases
    """
    if requires_compliance():
        return multi_layer_validation() + audit_trails()
    elif requires_scale():
        return async_processing() + caching_layers()
    return simple_and_maintainable()
```

## Currently

Researching multi-agent orchestration and vector search optimization. Mentoring engineers on distributed systems and AI system design. Writing technical content reaching 80k+ engineers and founders. Consulting AI teams for building better solutions.

### Let's build something together

Always excited to discuss AI system design, scaling challenges, and distributed systems architecture.
